# Astrocat Lobby

This project contains a Phaser 3 prototype that showcases a customizable character profile alongside a platforming playground.  Use the keyboard arrows or WASD to move, SPACE to jump and interact, and the **Customize** button to swap between hair, skin, and shirt colors.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server runs with Vite and will automatically reload when you change files.  To produce an optimized build run `npm run build`.

## Custom page background

Add a `webpagebackground.png` file to the `public/` directory to replace the default gradient backdrop that surrounds the lobby canvas. The image is applied automatically when present and falls back to the gradient when removed.
