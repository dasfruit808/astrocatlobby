# Gameplay User Experience Enhancement Ideas

This document outlines optional improvements that can make the Astrocat Lobby more welcoming and replayable for players. Each idea is framed so it can ship incrementally without disrupting the existing prototype flow.

## Onboarding and Guidance
- **Contextual control tips:** Display lightweight prompts near the avatar when players stand still, reminding them about movement keys, interaction buttons, or the layout customization toggle. Fading the tips after they are used keeps the lobby visually clean while helping first-time visitors.
- **Interactive onboarding tasks:** Offer a short guided checklist the first time the lobby boots (e.g., "Talk to Nova", "Try customizing your look", "Visit the Starcade"). Players learn the core systems by completing each task and receiving immediate feedback.
- **Discoverability for embedded games:** Highlight active cabinets or mini games with animated floor decals or HUD callouts whenever new content is available so players can quickly locate fresh activities.

## Feedback and Responsiveness
- **Moment-to-moment feedback:** Add subtle screen shake, particles, or sound sweeteners when landing from a jump or activating interactable objects. Reinforcing actions with sensory feedback makes the platforming feel tighter.
- **Dynamic NPC reactions:** Let lobby characters react when players approach—waving, sharing short dialogue, or offering tips about nearby activities—to make the space feel inhabited.
- **Progress notifications:** Surface small toast messages or a HUD panel that celebrates milestones (collectibles found, mini game high scores, or new customization options) to motivate continued play.

## Progression and Goals
- **Daily or weekly challenges:** Rotate optional objectives such as "complete three Starcade runs" or "find all floating data shards today". Time-bound goals encourage repeat visits without forcing a grind.
- **Cosmetic unlock tracks:** Tie new customization swatches or accessories to achievements, encouraging players to explore different activities to expand their wardrobe.
- **Exploration rewards:** Hide collectible lore items or shortcuts around the playground to reward curiosity and build world depth.

## Accessibility and Comfort
- **Remappable controls and sensitivity sliders:** Allow players to redefine keys, tweak gamepad mappings, or adjust camera movement to match their comfort and hardware.
- **Assist options:** Offer jump timing assistance, collision forgiveness, or optional navigation beacons so new players can still enjoy the playground.
- **Visual and audio comfort settings:** Provide colorblind-safe palettes for UI elements, subtitle support for voiced dialogue, adjustable text size, and volume sliders with per-channel control (music, effects, dialogue).

## Social and Community Hooks
- **Ghost runs and leaderboards:** Record personal bests in platforming challenges or Starcade sessions, then let friends load ghost replays to race asynchronously.
- **Photo mode and sharing:** Enable a lightweight photo mode with filters or emotes so players can capture and share their customized avatars directly from the lobby.
- **Rotating community spotlights:** Surface recommended mini games, featured player outfits, or developer messages in the lobby to keep the space feeling alive between content drops.

These enhancements can be mixed and matched depending on production bandwidth. Start with low-effort wins like contextual control tips and improved audio/visual feedback before exploring larger systems such as progression tracks or social integrations.
